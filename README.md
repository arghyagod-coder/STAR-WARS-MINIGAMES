# STAR-WARS MINIGAME

#### A super project made in PyGame

You all have surely heard of *STAR WARS*, the mega-successful film series. It has been a few months since I left learning *PyGame*, and all game dev stuff with Python, and have surely lost a lot of experience. Now I recall my game dev skills (*PRETTY NOOBISH ONES*) once again to make a game in Python. This game's inspired from *STAR WARS* (Though I never saw any of the movies in the series)

<br>

## Features-

- Has 2 relaxing games that are a cure to your stress, anytime in life
- As it's Python, supported in all OS
- The pixel graphics and the old-style interface is bound to burst nostalgia to a 90s arcade gamer
